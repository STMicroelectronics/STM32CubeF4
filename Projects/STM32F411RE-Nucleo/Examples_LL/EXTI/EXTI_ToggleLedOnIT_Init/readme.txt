@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure the EXTI and use
GPIOs to toggle the user LEDs available on the board when
a user button is pressed. This example is based on the
STM32F4xx LL API. Peripheral initialization is done using LL
initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

In this example, one EXTI line (EXTI13) is configured to generate
an interrupt on each falling edge.

In the interrupt routine a led connected to a specific GPIO pin is toggled.

In this example:
    - EXTI13 is connected to PC.13 pin
      - when falling edge is detected on EXTI13 by pressing User push-button, LED2 toggles

On NUCLEO-F411RE:
    - EXTI13 is connected to User push-button

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F411xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F411RE board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
