@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral to perform 
a single ADC conversion of a channel, at each software start; 
Example using programming model: interrupt 
(for programming models polling or DMA transfer, refer to
other examples); 
This example is based on the STM32F4xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:
At each press on User Button, the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
When conversion is completed, ADC interruption occurs.
IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from ADC data register
and stores it into a variable, LED2 is turned on.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED2
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
