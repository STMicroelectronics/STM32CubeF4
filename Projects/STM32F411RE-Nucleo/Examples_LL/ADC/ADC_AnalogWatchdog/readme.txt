@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral with ADC analog watchdog
to monitor a channel and detect when the corresponding conversion data is
out of window thresholds; 
This example is based on the STM32F4xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
Analog watchdog is configured to monitor all channels on group regular
(therefore, including the selected channel), 
low threshold is set to 0V and high threshold is set to Vdda/2.
ADC interruption enabled: Analog watchdog 1.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, the ADC converts the selected channel continuously.
When conversion data is out of analog watchdog window, ADC interruption occurs.
Into analog watchdog callback function, a status variable is set
and a LED2 is turned-on (LED2 turns ON into Analog Watchdog window).
At each press on User Button, the ADC analog watchdog is rearmed to be ready
for another trig.

LED2 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error.

Note: In case of noise on voltage applied on ADC channel input, ADC analog watchdog
      may trig at a voltage level with an uncertainty of tens of mV.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "ubAnalogWatchdog1Status": analog watchdog state

Connection needed: use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect 
it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED2
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
