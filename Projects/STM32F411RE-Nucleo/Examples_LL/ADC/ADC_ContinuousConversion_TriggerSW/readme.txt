@par Example Description
This example describes how to use a ADC peripheral to perform
continuous ADC conversions of a channel, from a SW start; 
This example is based on the STM32F4xx ADC LL API; 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.

Example execution:
From the first press on User Button, the ADC converts the selected channel
continuously.
After the first trigger (software start in this example), following conversions
are launched successively automatically, indefinitely.
Software polls for the first conversion completion
and stores it into a variable, LED2 is turned on.
Main program reads frequently ADC conversion data 
(without waiting for end of each conversion: software reads data 
when main program execution pointer is available and can let 
some ADC conversions data unread and overwritten by newer data)
and stores it into the same variable.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC conversion data computation to physical values

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User Button
  1 GPIO for LED2
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
