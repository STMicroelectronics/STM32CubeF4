@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC2 and DMA to transfer continuously converted data from 
ADC2 to memory.

The ADC2 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_5.

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC2 DR register to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 180MHz, APB2 = 90MHz, APB1 = 45MHz 
and ADC clock = APB2/4 = 22.5MHz.
Since ADC2 clock is 22.5 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/22.5= 0.66us (1.5 Mega-sample/sec)

User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_5 voltage by applying an input voltage on pin PA5 (e.g. using signal generator)

STM32 Discovery board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED1 is ON when the conversion is complete.
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error in ADC initialization, in ADC channel configuration 
    or during conversion process.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PH7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32469I-DISCOVERY board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
