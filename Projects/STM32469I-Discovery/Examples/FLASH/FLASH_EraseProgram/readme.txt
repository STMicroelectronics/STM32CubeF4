@par Example Description 

This example describes how to configure and use the FLASH HAL API to erase and program 
the internal Flash memory.
  
At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) 
to run at 180 MHz. 

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. A dedicated function
is used to enable the FLASH control register access.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase sector feature. The erase procedure is done by filling the erase init 
structure giving the starting erase sector and the number of sectors to erase.
At this stage, all these sectors will be erased one by one separately.

@note: if problem occurs on a sector, erase will be stopped and faulty sector will 
be returned to user (through variable 'sectorError').

Once this operation is finished, sector word programming operation will be performed 
in the Flash memory. The written data is then read back and checked.

The STM32469I-DISCOVERY board LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when there are no errors detected after data programming 
 - LED2 is ON when there are errors detected after data programming 
 - LED3 is ON when there is an issue during erase or program procedure

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PH7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the boards power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32469I-DISCOVERY board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
