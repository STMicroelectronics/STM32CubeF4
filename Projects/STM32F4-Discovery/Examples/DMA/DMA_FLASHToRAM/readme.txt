@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA to transfer 
a word data buffer from Flash memory to embedded SRAM through 
the HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 168 MHz.

DMA2 Stream0 channel0 is configured to transfer the contents of a 32-word data 
buffer stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA2 Stream0 channel0 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA2 Stream0 channel0.
At the end of the transfer a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled and the callback function (customized by user) is called.
 

STM32 Discovery board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED4 is ON when the transfer is complete (into the Transfer Complete interrupt
   routine).
 - LED5 is ON when there are an error of the transfer (into the Transfer error 
   interrupt routine)
 - LED3 is ON when there are an error in the transfer process or in initialisation 
  (into the Transfer error interrupt routine)

It is possible to select a different Stream and/or channel for the DMA transfer
example by modifying defines values in the file main.h.
Note that only DMA2 Streams are able to perform Memory-to-Memory transfers.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F407xx devices.  
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F4-Discovery RevB & RevC 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.    
  

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
