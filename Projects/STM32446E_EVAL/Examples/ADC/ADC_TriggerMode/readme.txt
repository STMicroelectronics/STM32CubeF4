@par Example Description 

How to use ADC1 and TIM2 to continuously convert data from an ADC channel. 
Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started 
by the ADC.

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new conversion is started by ADC1.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC1 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
  From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 180 MHz.
  2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 180 MHz.
  3) APB1 Prescaler = 4 => PCLK1 clock is 180 MHz/4 = 45 MHz.
  4) For Timer 2, as APB1 Prescaler = 4, Timer 2 Clock is PCLK1 clock X 2 = 180 MHz/2.
  5) APB2 Prescaler = 2 => PCLK2 clock is 180 MHz/2 = 90 MHz.
  6) For ADC, as ADC Prescaler = 4, ADC Clock is PCLK2 clock / 4 = 22.5 MHz.

  For a 20 Khz frequency, we need (180 MHz/2) / 20 KHz = 5000 clock cycle.
  So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 5000;

The voltage on pin PA.04 (ADC_CHANNEL_4)can vary using the board potentiometer P2.
SB94 must be closed to use the potentiometer.

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F446xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32446E-EVAL board revB and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
