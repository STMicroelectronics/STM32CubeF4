@par Example Description
 
How to use the ADC in interrupt mode to convert data through the HAL API.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_10.

Each time an end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated and the converted 
data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the 
ADC conversion complete call back function.

In this example, the system clock is 180MHz, APB2 = 90MHz and ADC clock = APB2/4. 
Since ADC3 clock is 22.5 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/22.5= 0.66us(1.5Msps).

Please select PC0 option on JP3 jumper called Potentiometer

User can vary the ADC_CHANNEL_10 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer (RV1) connected to PC.0.
The converted value is monitored through debugger: uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested and validated with STM32469I-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32469I-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to  PC.0).
    - Make sure that JP3 is fitted in 2-3 positions to use potentiometer.
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
