@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 6 Steps.
The STM32F469xx TIM1 peripheral offers the possibility to program in advance the 
configuration for the next TIM1 outputs behaviour (step) and change the configuration
of all the channels at the same time. This operation is possible when the COM 
(commutation) event is used.

The COM event can be generated by software by setting the COM bit in the TIM1_EGR
register or by hardware (on TRC rising edge).
In this example, a software COM event is generated each 1 ms: using the SysTick 
interrupt.

The TIM1 is configured in Timing Mode, each time a COM event occurs, a new TIM1
configuration will be set in advance. Only changed states are programmed. 

The break Polarity is used at High level.

The following Table describes the TIM1 Channels states:

@note The connection of the LCD reset pin to a dedicated GPIO PK7 instead of the STM32F469 NRST pin may cause residual display on LCD with applications/examples that do not require display.
	  The LCD clear can be ensured by hardware through the board's power off/power on or by software calling the BSP_LCD_Reset() function.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F469xx/STM32F479xx devices.

  - This example has been tested and validated with STMicroelectronics STM32469I-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

  - STM32469I-EVAL Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08, pin 52 of CN6 connector)  
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PA.07, pin 22 of CN5 connector)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09, pin 43 of CN6 connector)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.00, pin 52 of CN5 connector)  
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PE.13, pin 19 of CN10 connector)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.01, pin 26 of CN5 connector)

    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PA.06) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
