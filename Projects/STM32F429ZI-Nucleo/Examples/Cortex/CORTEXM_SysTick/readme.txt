@par Example Description 
  
This example shows how to use the default configuration of SysTick with a time base 
equal to 1 ms in order to insert a delay between LEDs toggling.

  A "HAL_Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F429xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F429ZI  Rev.B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Open your preferred toolchain 
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
