@par Example Description

This projects provides a reference template through the LL API that can be used to build any firmware application.

This project LL template provides:
 - Inclusion of all LL drivers (include files in "main.h" and LL sources files in IDE environment, with option "USE_FULL_LL_DRIVER" in IDE environment)
   Note: If optimization is needed afterwards, user can perform a cleanup by removing unused drivers.
 - Definition of LEDs and user button (file: main.h)
   Note: User button name printed on board may differ from naming "user button" in code: "key button", ...
 - Clock configuration (file: main.c)

This project LL template does not provide:
 - Functions to initialize and control LED and user button
 - Functions to manage IRQ handler of user button

To port a LL example to the targeted board:
1. Select the LL example to port.
   To find the board on which LL examples are deployed, refer to LL examples list in "STM32CubeProjectsList.html", table section "Examples_LL"
   or AN4739: STM32Cube firmware examples for STM32F4 Series

2. Replace source files of the LL template by the ones of the LL example, except code specific to board.
   Note: Code specific to board is specified between tags:
         /* ==============   BOARD SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION CODE BEGIN    ============== */
         /* ==============   BOARD SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION CODE END      ============== */
         
   - Replace file main.h, with updates:
     - Keep LED and user button definition of the LL template under tags
    
   - Replace file main.c, with updates:
     - Keep clock configuration of the LL template: function "SystemClock_Config()"
     - Depending of LED availability, replace LEDx_PIN by another LEDx (number) available in file main.h
     
   - Replace file stm32f4xx_it.h
   - Replace file stm32f4xx_it.c

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This template runs on STM32F429xx devices.
    
  - This template has been tested with NUCLEO-F429ZI RevB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
