@par Example Description

This example presents the MPU feature. Its purpose is to configure a memory area
as privileged read-only area and attempt to perform read and write operations
in different modes.

If the access is permitted LED1 is toggling. If the access is not permitted, 
a memory management fault is generated and LED3 is ON.

To generate an MPU memory fault exception due to an access right error, press 
user button.

@par Keywords

System, Cortex, Memory regions, Privileged area, permitted access, memory management fault, MPU memory fault
