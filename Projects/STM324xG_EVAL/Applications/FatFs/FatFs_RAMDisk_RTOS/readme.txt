@par Application Description

How to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs middleware component as a generic FAT
file system module. This example develops an application exploiting FatFs
features with a RAM disk (SRAM) drive in RTOS mode configuration.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 168 MHz.
 
The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
it creates a normal priority thread and it's performed using FatFs APIs to 
access the FAT volume as described in the following steps: 

 - Link the SRAM disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the SRAM drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the SRAM drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the SRAM disk I/O driver.

It is worth noting that the application manages any error occurred during the 
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values 
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes 
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements. 
 
STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs. 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond to have correct 
      HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according to the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with FatFs".
