@par Example Description 

How to use ADC and TIM8 to continuously convert data from an ADC channel. 
Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM8 a new conversion is started 
by the ADC.

This example describes how to use the ADC3 and TIM8 to convert continuously data 
from ADC3 channel8.

The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously channel7(for STM324xG-EVAL).

Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM8 a new conversion is started by ADC3.
At the end of conversion an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function. 

The user can use the debugger's watch to evaluate uhADCxConvertedValue.

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).

User can vary the ADC3 channel7(for STM324xG-EVAL) voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer.

STM32 Eval boards LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
  - LED3 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F407xx/417xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM324xG-EVAL RevC evaluation board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM324xG-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to PF.09).


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
