@par Application Description

This application shows how to use the USB device application based on the Mass Storage Class (MSC) on the STM32F4xx devices.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32F412ZG USB OTG Device peripheral to communicate with a PC
Host using the Bulk Only Transfer (BOT) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) transparent commands, 
while the microSD card is used as storage media. The STM32 MCU is enumerated as a MSC device using the 
native PC Host MSC driver to which the STM32F412xG-Discovery board is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 100 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock which is coming from the PLL I2S.

The 48 MHz clock for the USB FS can be derived from one of the two following sources:
  – PLL clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLL as clock source, the PLL clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLVCO/PLLQ).
  – PLLI2S clock (clocked by the HSE): If the USB uses the PLLI2S as clock source, the PLLI2S clock must be programmed
    to output 48 MHz frequency (USBCLK = PLLI2SVCO/PLLI2SQ).
 
When the application is started, the user has just to plug the USB cable into a PC host and the device 
is automatically detected. A new removable drive appears in the system window and write/read/format 
operations can be performed as with any other removable drive.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F412xG devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F412xG-Discovery boards 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F412ZG-Nucleo Set-up
    - Insert a microSD card into the STM32F412ZG-Discovery uSD slot 
    - Connect the STM32F412ZG-Discovery board to the PC through 'USB micro A-Male 
      to A-Male' cable to the connector.
   - Please ensure that jumpers JP5 is fitted in position 1-2
